  <h2 class="deck"> Airlines and airports face rising costs and safety concerns as wildlife strikes become an increasingly common threat. </h1>

  <p> As air travel has expanded, so has the risk posed by wildlife strikes. In 2022, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported over 17,000 incidents involving birds and larger animals like deer and alligators. The aviation industry has worked for decades to combat this issue with innovative strategies to reduce risks to safety and operations.
 </p>

  <p> These incidents pose two separate challenges to the aviation industry: the significant economic costs of repairs and delays and the serious safety risks posed to passengers and crew. A scenario like a flock of birds near a busy airport or a deer straying onto an active runway raises significant concerns.  </p>

  <p> Richard Dolbeer, a wildlife biologist who has studied the interaction between wildlife and aviation since the 1980s, attributes the rise in strikes to several factors. He explains that wildlife populations began recovering in the 1980s due to new environmental legislation and advancements in aviation technology. Once the population resurgence began, Dolbeer says he started getting calls from airports asking, “What do I do? All of the sudden, I’ve got these Canada geese on my airport, and we’ve never had them before, and how do I get rid of them?” Larger aircraft and the widespread adoption of jet engines increased the likelihood of wildlife collisions.

 </p>

  <p>In the 1990s, Dolbeer worked to create the FAA Wildlife Strike Database. It is a voluntary database where airlines and airports can submit information on any wildlife strikes. While airports are required to report strikes they become aware of, pilots and airlines are not and can submit voluntarily. Once a strike is reported, airport teams collect the remains and either identify the species on site or send samples to the Smithsonian Institution for further analysis.
</p>

  <p>The data is crucial for biologists like Dolbeer, who have studied these strikes to identify trends and create ways to mitigate and prevent them. One prominent pattern reveals that wildlife strikes are most common in summer and early fall. This timing aligns with birds’ migration and reproductive cycles. Dolbeer gives the example of Canadian geese, whose population surges in July compared to May, significantly increasing the likelihood of collisions during this time.

  <p> Wildlife strikes pose both severe economic and safety concerns for airlines. Estimating the total costs of these strikes each year is challenging, but airlines recognize it as a serious problem. The direct costs can be substantial, including an engine repair or windshield replacement. Indirect costs, like flight cancellations or providing accommodations for displaced passengers, also add to the ripple effect of a strike.
 </p>

  <p>Wildlife strikes create serious safety concerns as well. While the loss of life due to a wildlife strike is infrequent, it is always a thought in the minds of those working on this issue. An example of a near-tragedy scenario was the “Miracle on the Hudson” in 2009, when an aircraft hit a flock of birds, causing it to have both engines fail. The severity of a strike can differ, depending on many factors, but whenever there is damage, it is always a cause of concern for the airline and airports.

  <p> Mitigation and prevention efforts are crucial to addressing this complex problem. Almost every large airport in the U.S. has a certified wildlife biologist who works to develop and implement mitigation and prevention strategies. Their job includes doing runway inspections, eliminating any locations for habitats, and coordinating with the maintenance and grounds teams to keep the area as sterile as possible and undesirable for wildlife. Airports use harassment tactics like pyrotechnics, trained dogs, and noise devices to deter wildlife. After a while, the birds and other wildlife become used to any tactics used to scare them, causing them to begin to ignore it. In some cases, they resort to lethal control measures to discourage others from inhabiting the area. Wildlife teams must always keep up with the latest wildlife regulations to ensure any action they take follows the rules.
 </p>

  <p> An example of an airport that dedicates lots of resources to this problem is John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. JFK is surrounded by water on three sides and has a wildlife refuge just south in Jamaica Bay. With their three wildlife biologists on staff, the airport invests heavily in prevention and mitigation. Airlines, which pay millions annually to use major airports, expect these facilities to manage wildlife risks effectively to avoid additional costs.
</p>

  <p> Dolbeer recalls an incident at JFK Airport a few years ago when a snowy owl wouldn’t leave the area. The wildlife management team ended up shooting the owl, which went against environmental regulations. The situation caused public backlash and showed how complicated managing wildlife near airports can be.</p>

  <p>As air travel continues to grow, so will the challenge of mitigating and preventing aircraft strikes. Airplanes continue to evolve, and new solutions will need to be created to adjust to the aviation and environmental landscape of the time. After more than 40 years of research, experts like Dolbeer have significantly advanced our understanding of this complex issue. The work done by these teams aims to reduce wildlife strikes further to ensure the safety of passengers and crew while lowering the financial burden on airlines. </p>
